## Technical Background

I started programming in high school, beginning with some free online courses. By the time I started college, I had  
experience with HTML, CSS, and Python. I then completed a bachelor's in Information Systems at GVSU, joining the  
combined Bachelor's of Information Systems/ Master's of Applied Computer Science program partway through my   
undergrad years. As an undergrad, I studied more HTML and CSS, Java, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and COBOL.  
Since starting my master's, I have also spent more time with Java, studied Python, worked in R, and learned concepts  
about algorithms, artificial intelligence, information visualization, and more.  
  
Outside of school, I did an IT internship at Kellogg's, where among other projects, I spearheaded a project to create a  
new website and career assessment test for a local nonprofit helping Burmese immigrant children in Battle Creek, MI.  
As a fairly inexperienced coder with very little access to help, this was a project that I grew a lot from. The summer  
before my senior year, I began working at OST in Grand Rapids on the Configuration Services team, where I worked as  
a CET developer, learning a proprietary programming language used for 3D design. I interned there full-time and  
continued to work part-time during my senior year until a medical diagnosis stopped me. I plan to continue working  
there once I have the availability.
