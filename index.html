  <div id="technicalText">
    <p>I started programming in high school, beginning with some free online courses. By the time I started college,
    I had experience with HTML, CSS, and Python. I then completed a bachelor's in Information Systems at
    GVSU, joining the combined Bachelor's of Information Systems/ Master's of Applied Computer Science
    program partway through my undergrad years. As an undergrad, I studied more HTML and CSS, Java,
    JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and COBOL. Since starting my master's, I have also spent more time with
    Java, studied Python, worked in R, and learned concepts about algorithms, artificial intelligence, information
    visualization, and more. </p>
    </br>
    <p>Outside of school, I did an IT internship at Kellogg's, where among other projects, I spearheaded a project to
    create a  new website and career assessment test for a local nonprofit helping Burmese immigrant children in
    Battle Creek, MI. As a fairly inexperienced coder with very little access to help, this was a project that I grew a
    lot from. The summer before my senior year, I began working at OST in Grand Rapids on the Configuration
    Services team, where I worked as a CET developer, learning a proprietary programming language used for 3D
    design. I interned there full-time and continued to work part-time during my senior year until a medical diagnosis
    stopped me. I plan to continue working there once I have the availability.</p>

  <div id="projectText">
    <p>This semester in CIS 641, I am creating an app that will be called Commentarius (Latin for "diary") which is intended
to allow people to create freeform diary entries and tag specific areas of text within entries with
custom tags. The user can then access individual entries or access all text which has been given
a certain tag. Users can create, read, update, and delete entries or tagged text. They can also filter
entries or tagged text by year or month. The app is especially targeted toward people who have
serious medical diagnoses, whose entries may contain things like questions for doctors,
breakthroughs, side effects, etc. Each of these categories could be assigned a tag. The overall
goal of the app is to allow people to write freely but easily access specific categories of text later.</p>
